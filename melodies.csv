He slept only for a few hours, ate small quantities of food and spoke little.<br/><br/>One day he disappeared while having his morning bath and reappeared 3 days later and said: There is no Hindu and there is no Muslim. By saying this he meant that titles were meaningless because all of humanity is one and the light of God shines within everyone."

3,Guru Ram Das,ਮਃ ੪,"Guru Ram Das [1534 - 1581] is the fourth Guru of the Sikhs, whose original name was Jetha and who was born in Lahore. Bhai Jetha married Bibi Bhani who was the daughter of the third Guru, Guru Amar Das.<br/><br/>Guru Ram Das founded the city of Ram Das Pur, now called Amritsar, and built the central Sikh temple, the Harimandir Sahib or Golden Temple. He initiated the concept of community voluntary service known as Kar Seva."
4,Guru Arjan Dev,ਮਃ ੫,"Guru Arjan Dev [1563 - 1606] was the fifth Guru of the Sikhs, born at Goindval. He was the youngest of the three sons of Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru.<br/><br/>Guru Arjan Dev finished the construction of the Harimandir Sahib, the Golden Temple, and compiled the first Sikh scripture, known as the Adi Granth. Shortly after he became the first martyr of the Sikh religion, which formed a turning point in the development of the faith."
5,Guru Amar Das,ਮਃ ੩,"Guru Amar Das [1479 - 1574] was the third Guru of the Sikhs, born at Basarke in Amritsar. His father, Tej Bhan and mother Bakht Kaur were orthodox Hindus. He became the oldest Sikh Guru.<br/></br>Guru Amar Das put an end to tradition of sati, the burning of the widow on her husbands funeral pyre, and encouraged the remarriage of widows.

His father was named Pheru and worked as a small businessman. <br/><br/>Bhai Lehna always did everything that Guru Nanak asked, which is why Guru Nanak renamed Bhai Lehna as his Ang or limb of his body.<br/><br/>Guru Angad Dev simplified the old Punjabi characters into a new alphabet, called Gurmukhi. He thus gave the people the gift of literature. He took great interest in the education of children and opened several schools."
7,Saint Kabir,ਭਗਤ ਕਬੀਰ,"Saint Kabir [1440 - 1518] was a Muslim mystic born in Varanasi in India, whose 541 hymns are included in the Guru Granth Sahib. His writings about God are full of love and devotion, very direct and striking in appeal.<br/><br/>The birth of Kabir remains to this day shrouded in mystery and legend. Authorities disagree on both when he was born and who his parents were. One legend proclaims a divine virginal birth. His mother was reputed to have been of the Brahman caste and to have become pregnant after a visit to a Hindu shrine.<br/><br/>Because she was unwed, she abandoned Kabir, who was found and adopted by a Muslim weaver. That his early life began as a Muslim there is no doubt, although he later became influenced by the Hindu ascetic, Ramananda, who he accepted as his Guru."
8,Saint Trilochan,ਭਗਤ ਤ੍ਰਿਲੋਚਨ,"Saint Trilochan [1267 - ?], a name which literally means three-eyed, the seer of the present, past and future, was a celebrated saint of the Hindu Vaishya caste. There are four hymns by him in the Guru Granth Sahib, in which he has condemned superficial rituals and pretentious renunciation and stressed the holiness of the heart.<br/><br/>Saint Trilochan always gave more importance to love and devotion in preference to selfish interests. He believed that he who is always occupied with problems relating to wealth and property would never become happy. He always served the saints at his residence with the utmost dedication and humility.<br/><br/>The exact place of birth of Bhagat Trilochan is not known. Some historians claim its Barsi near Sholapur, Maharastra and others claim its Uttar Pradesh. But it is an accepted fact that he spent most of his time in Maharashtra. The fact that two hymns of Saint Kabir constitute a dialogue between Saint Namdev and Saint Trilochan shows that these two saints were friends, and in fact it was Namdev who introduced Trilochan to his Guru who showed him the way to God."
9,Saint Beni,ਭਗਤ ਬੇਣੀ,"Saint Beni [15th - 16th Century] was a Hindu mystic whose teachings have been incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib. It is believed he spent most of his time in prayer and meditation, and often neglected his household needs - so God himself intervened and physically appeared to help him several times.<br/><br/>Saint Beni has three hymns in the Guru Granth Sahib marked by an intense spiritual longing. They also indicate the various paths tried by him in his quest, his practical experience of life and his mastery of religious lore of diverse traditions."

The Guru travelled extensively in the Punjab and in other parts of the country to spread the teachings of Guru Nanak.<br/><br/>The ruler at the time was the Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb who was forcing the Hindus to accept Islam. Some of these Hindus went to visit the Guru and ask for his help.<br/><br/>Guru Tegh Bahadur decided to give up his life to protect the right of all people to practice whatever religion they choose.

His father was called Damshet, a tailor, and his mother was called Gonabai.<br/><br/>The main spiritual message of Saint Namdev, just like the Sikh Gurus, was to emphasise the importance of living a married householder life and that through marriage, living in the world and meditating on God, one could attain enlightenment. Sixty-one of his hymns are included in the Guru Granth Sahib. He was also a close friend of Saint Trilochan."

Bhakta Bhikhan was a devotee in the tradition of Saint Ravidas and Saint Dhana, born at Kakori near Lucknow in present day Uttar Pardesh.

19,Saint Sain,ਭਗਤ ਸੈਣ,"Saint Sain [14th - 15th Century], whose one hymn has been included in the Guru Granth Sahib, is counted among the disciples of the famous Saint Ramanand. Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, says in one of his hymns that Sain means a devotee with rare devotion.

The Goddess, it is said, once told him in a dream to visit Varanasi and receive initiation from Saint Ramanand.<br/><br/>Pipa went to Varanasi, but Saint Ramanand refused to see him in his gaudy robes. Pipa cast off his royal apparel and put on poor ones, after which he was initiated and began to live like an ascetic. At his invitation, Saint Ramanand visited Gagaraun, and King Pipa lent his shoulder to the palanquin carrying Ramanand in a procession.<br/><br/>Pipa now finally decided to give up his throne and retire to a life of seclusion and meditation. He went to Dwarka where Lord Krishna, after the Mahabharata, had spent the last years of his life. All the twelve wives of Pipa insisted on accompanying him, but he took along only one, named Sita, who had a spiritual inclination.

The theme of his poem, Sadu meaning call, is the ascension of Guru Amar Das, described in terms of his having been recalled by God.<br/><br/>The hymn states how Guru Amar Das had completely surrendered himself to the Will of the Supreme Being, ever remaining absorbed in meditation on the Name of God, how he had, through the favour of Gurus, attained the office of Guru, how he, at the time of his departure, had appointed Guru Ram Das as his successor and how he had told his family to abide by the Will of the Lord and not to weep for him after his death."
